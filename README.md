This software is used to simplify making discord bots. This is nested within the "Client" class. Upon creating a client through this module,
you get access to the variable "XTend". Through this, you can set permissions, change default responses to errors, make commands, and much more.

Commands:
If you wish to add commands, this can be done through Client.XTend.AddCommand(). If you need to remove excess commands so that your bots won't clutter itself,
you add all required commands, then run Client.XTend.ClearExcessCommands().
